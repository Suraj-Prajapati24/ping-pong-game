# 🏓 Ping Pong Game (Single Player)</h1>

## 📖 About the Game

This **Ping Pong Game** is a single-player 2D game inspired by the legendary **Pong (1972)**.
The player controls a paddle and competes against an computer-controlled opponent.

The challenge increases over time as the **ball speed gradually increases**, making it harder to react.
To maintain fair gameplay, the **Computer paddle speed is capped after a certain level**, encouraging players to
focus on scoring higher rather than surviving indefinitely.
